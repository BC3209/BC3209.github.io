Today I turn 31. I was planning on writing something last year and titling it "30 for 30," like the ESPN documentaries, but I flaked. Not this year! If I had to choose just one word to sum up this past year, it would be jam-packed (hyphenated words count as one, right?). Jam-packed full of life lessons. Jam-packed full of emotional rollercoasters and jam-packed full of uncertainty. Even with all of that, I still find myself filled with an abundance of gratitude.

Enough of my rambling. Here's my list of 31 things that I've been grateful for during these past couple of years.
