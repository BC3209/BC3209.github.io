The book "Three Magic Words: The Key to Power, Peace and Plenty" was profound,
to say the least. If you ever get a chance, you should pick it up and give it a
read. Here's the 30-day mental diet summarized from the chapter titled "Faith."

1. You are not to accept a single negative thought nor dwell on a single
negative premise.
2. This does not mean that such thoughts or ideas will not occur to you.
3. This simply means that you will refuse to accept any of them, discarding
them as soon as they occur as fictional ideas.
4. Carry around a notebook and keep a record of every negative thought you
entertain.

What are these thoughts that we are refusing to entertain?

They are any thoughts that might in the smallest or greatest manner cast into a
pessimistic or poor light of yourself, your family, your friends, your social
group, your state, your nation, or the entire human race.

They are, in short, negative thoughts of any type, regardless of whether they
seem personally aimed at you, yourself, or even an inanimate object.

We are deliberately compelling ourselves to reject all suffering, all sorrow,
all depression, all morbidness, all inferiority, all aches and pains.

You are what you choose to be, and your choice is made in mind. Seek the high
and forsake the low. A man adds all things unto himself simply by taking a
position with impregnable faith.
